# MRO Predictions
There are two kinds of tasks:
1. Predict the occurrences of transactions (year, quarter, month, week);
2. Predict the quantity of each transaction.

Also, there are two subsets of data:
1. Data with scheduled activities (preventive & predictive)
2. Data without scheduled activities (corrective & reactive)
