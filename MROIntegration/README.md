# MRO Integration
Implements interactions of both directions between the MRO instance (where all operations are initiated) and the ML instance (another virtual environment where machine learning models will be used): 
1. ML programs are able to connect to the MRO database to read and write data;
2. The MRO instance is able to invoke ML programs in the ML instance.
